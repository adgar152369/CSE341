\
4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.\
	- For some reason I\'92m getting an error about connecting to Mongo, and a lot of other classmates have the same problem. I have looked up more updated methods in the past in this course, like \'93findByPk\'94, and they have worked. So I will do the same with this error.\
\
5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.\
	- the coolest thing this week was learning to simply use the MongoDB GUI interface and implement documents.\
\
6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?\
	- This lesson specifically, I think there should be mentions about more updated methods of mongo / mongoose.\
\
7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:\
   1 - Some attempt was made\
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient\
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate\
   4 - Meets requirements *\
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements\
\
8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.\
Since I followed all of the videos, I have met the requirements. But since I\'92m getting an error, I believe a 4 is accurate.\
